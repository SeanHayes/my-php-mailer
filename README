An example of sending multipart emails (including attachments) via PHP's mail() function.

index.php contains the form for composing the message. The form on that page POSTs to mail.php, which constructs the message and sends it.

No input validation has been performed, the main focus of this script is the actual sending of multipart email messages.

In order for the email to be delivered, sendmail and postfix will have to be properly configured. If run on a personal computer, and if forward-confirmed reverse DNS is not setup, email will likely be marked as SPAM.
